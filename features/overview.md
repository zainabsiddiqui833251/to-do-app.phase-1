# Project Overview: Evolution of Todo – Phase I

## Goal
Build a command-line Todo application in Python that stores tasks in memory.

## Scope (Phase I only)
Implement the 5 Basic Level features:
- Add Task
- List Tasks
- Update Task
- Delete Task
- Mark as Complete

No persistence, no database, no external dependencies.

## Success Criteria
A clean, modular console application that runs with `python src/main.py` and provides a simple numbered menu for all operations.
